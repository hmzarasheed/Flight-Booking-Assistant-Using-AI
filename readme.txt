To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and a Jupyter environment (like Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook).

1. Clone the Repository (or create the file)
First, get the Flight Book Assistand.ipynb notebook. If you have it as a file, you can skip this step. Otherwise, create a new Jupyter notebook and copy the provided code into its cells.

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up OpenAI API Key
You'll need an OpenAI API key to use the GPT model and DALL-E image generation.

Get your API Key: If you don't have one, sign up at OpenAI Platform and generate a new secret key.

Create a .env file: In the same directory as your Flight Book Assistand.ipynb file, create a file named .env.

Add your API key to .env:

OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Run in Jupyter Lab
